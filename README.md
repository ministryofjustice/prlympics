# PR-Lympics

## How to play

1. Start a timer
1. Clone this repository
1. Create a file `names/[your name]` (this can be empty)
1. Push a branch containing your change
1. Raise a pull request
1. Stop the timer
1. Add a note to [this page] telling us your time, and any tools/tricks you used to help

> If you don't have write access to this repo, post to [#ask-cloud-platform] with

## Purpose

The goal is to highlight and measure the overhead of raising a PR.

Whenever you want to contribute to a project, you have to raise a PR.

Let's say the change you want to make is to fix a small typo. It might take you
a second or two to make the change. But, if the process of raising a PR to
contribute your change to the project takes several minutes, you might not
bother, and the typo won't be fixed.

If we can reduce the overhead of contributing to projects, maybe more
contributions will happen, and everybody wins.

## Rules/Guidelines

* The use of any general-purpose tools is encouraged (e.g. [hub], [ghi], IDEs, editor plugins, shell scripts, aliases, copy/paste)
* Using a tool created specifically for this task is *cheating* (i.e. writing a shell script to add your name and raise a PR to this repo)
* [Share your knowledge][this page]
* It's not about "winning", it's about reducing friction/overhead for everyone. If you measure the overhead, you can work to reduce it.
